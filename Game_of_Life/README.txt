References for Game_of_Life: The biggest references that we used was GeeksForGeeks when we needed extra help with either pointers or certain commands to pause or exit the game. When we encountered smaller problems such as segmentation faults or inconsistent results, we would run test cases within our code to see what was causing the problem.

Issues for Game_of_Life: There were plenty of issues because of how many moving pieces were involved with the project. A big issue that took us a few days to figure out were how to efficiently swap and update the grid multiple times. The other big issue that we ran into early on that took us a couple days to nail down was how to initialize a grid with cells at random positions. Other smaller issues were how to get the user to press ENTER to continue and exit the game, as well as pausing the game, but those issues were not as complex and only took us a few hours.
